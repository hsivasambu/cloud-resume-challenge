    <h1 style="margin: 0 0 10px;">About Me</h1>
    <p style="margin: 0; color: var(--muted);">
      I'm a Technical Project Manager with experience spanning cloud infrastructure, AI/ML, and digital
      health innovation. My work sits at the intersection of technology, people, and execution, helping
      cross-functional teams turn complex ideas into scalable, real-world solutions that create measurable
      impact.
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 10px 0 0; color: var(--muted);">
      Over the past several years, I've led multidisciplinary teams across healthcare, research, and
      enterprise environments. In my current role at Stryker, I manage large-scale implementations of cloud
      and on-premise communication platforms, working closely with engineers, clinicians, and external
      partners to deliver secure, reliable, and user-centered systems. This environment has sharpened how I
      lead through ambiguity, balance competing priorities, and translate technical complexity into clear
      execution plans.
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 10px 0 0; color: var(--muted);">
      It was during my time at Stryker that I gained deeper awareness of my natural working style through
      the Gallup CliftonStrengths framework. My top strengths-<strong>Learner, Strategic, Analytical,
      Restorative, and Arranger</strong>-closely reflect how I approach problem-solving and leadership in
      practice. I'm naturally driven to continuously learn and adapt, especially in fast-evolving technical
      spaces like cloud platforms and AI. I tend to quickly identify patterns, risks, and opportunities,
      helping teams move forward with clarity even in uncertain or highly complex environments. I'm also
      drawn to diagnosing problems at their root and building practical, sustainable solutions, often
      coordinating people, tools, and timelines to keep momentum moving forward.
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 10px 0 0; color: var(--muted);">
      Earlier in my career at Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital, I supported digital
      transformation initiatives that blended applied research, cloud computing, and emerging technologies.
      This included leading machine learning-driven clinical tools, deploying cloud infrastructure, and
      introducing 3D scanning and additive manufacturing workflows that improved patient outcomes and
      operational efficiency. These experiences reinforced my ability to bridge technical depth with
      real-world impact across diverse stakeholder groups.
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 10px 0 0; color: var(--muted);">
      Across roles, I've consistently gravitated toward work that requires both strategic thinking and
      hands-on execution-whether guiding cross-functional teams, aligning technical delivery with
      organizational goals, or helping teams navigate complexity with confidence. I bring a strong foundation
      in cloud platforms, AI/ML, and modern development practices, paired with structured project management
      and a collaborative leadership style.
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 10px 0 0; color: var(--muted);">
      I'm most energized by opportunities that combine innovation, technical depth, and meaningful impact.
      I'm currently seeking roles where I can contribute to forward-thinking teams working on cloud, AI, and
      emerging technologies, helping turn ambitious ideas into scalable, well-executed solutions.
