For a long time, building things was how I learned best.

While studying Engineering at McMaster University, that usually meant breaking things, fixing them, rebuilding them, and _very_ slowly understanding how systems actually worked under the hood. It was messy, frustrating, and incredibly rewarding. Somewhere along the way, as my career shifted deeper into project management and leadership roles, that hands-on time slowly faded. I stayed close to technology, but not always _inside_ it.

This blog is my attempt to change that.

## Why now

Technology is moving faster than ever. AI, cloud infrastructure, automation, and open source ecosystems are evolving at a pace that makes passive learning almost useless. Reading about tools is no longer enough. Watching demos is no longer enough. Coming out of school, I felt like I was on the leading edge of technology and equipped to be a key contributor to any team, using any technology. I'm not afraid to admit that I don't feel like that right now, but I'm confident that I can get back.

At the same time, my work has increasingly pulled me toward coordination rather than creation. I spend more time aligning teams, managing timelines, and translating between technical and non-technical stakeholders. That skill set is valuable, but it comes with a cost: distance from the craft.

## What this space is for

This will be a place to:

- Document projects I’m actively building
- Share lessons learned the hard way
- Explore ideas across cloud, AI, infrastructure, and systems design
- Reflect on how technical work intersects with leadership, collaboration, and learning

Some posts will be polished. Others will be rough working notes. That’s intentional. Learning in public forces clarity and accountability.

You can expect content like:

- Building and deploying small systems end to end
- Infrastructure experiments (cloud, automation, CI/CD)
- Reflections on technical leadership and decision-making
- Notes from experiments that didn’t work and why

## Why building still matters

There’s something different that happens when you actually build something. You confront tradeoffs. You hit constraints. You feel the friction between theory and reality.

Building forces questions like:

- What actually breaks at scale?
- What assumptions did I not know I was making?
- Where does abstraction help, and where does it hide risk?

Those questions matter whether you’re writing code, leading a team, or designing systems that people depend on.

## Learning in public

Publishing learning can feel uncomfortable. You expose uncertainty. You leave a trail of thinking that might evolve or even prove wrong later.

This blog is not about presenting expertise. It’s about documenting curiosity, growth, and continuous learning in a field that does not stand still.

If you’re also navigating the balance between building and managing, or trying to stay technically sharp while working across disciplines, you might find something useful here.

## What’s coming next

Some upcoming topics I plan to explore:

- Relearning the basics through hands-on projects for quick-wins
- Building foundational cloud skills through real projects
- Using AI tools as collaborators rather than shortcuts
- Designing systems that are simple, observable, and resilient

If you’re reading this, you’re invited to follow along, challenge ideas, or build alongside me.
